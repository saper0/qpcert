This is a network of US counties, where edges come from the Facebook Social Connectedness Index:
https://dataforgood.fb.com/tools/social-connectedness-index/
The edge list file is:
US-county-fb-graph.txt

The node features are constructed from USDA demographic data:
https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/county-level-data-sets/
as well as county-level U.S. presidential election statistics formatted by Tony McGovern:
https://github.com/tonmcg/US_County_Level_Election_Results_08-16

The nodes in the edge list are identified by FIPS county codes. The node
features for 2012 and 2016 are in:
US-county-fb-2012-feats.csv
US-county-fb-2016-feats.csv

Each feature is normalized to have zero mean and unit standard deviation. The
features are
sh050m, sh100m, sh500m: fraction of friends within 50, 100, 500 miles
income
migration
birth rate
death rate
education level
unemployment level
election outcome: (gop votes - democratic votes) / (gop votes + democratic votes)
